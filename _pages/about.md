![Illlustration of combing 3D model generation](./images/homepage.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
I'm a first year master student in the University of Tokyo, working with [Prof. Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/).

My research interest is in 3D game& 3D world & 3D scene generation and physical simulation.
